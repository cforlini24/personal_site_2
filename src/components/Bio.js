            <p id="bioText">My name is Chase Forlini and I'm a 24 year old living in Georgia. I got my BBA in economics from the University of Georgia but am looking for a change in paths. That's why I'm attending Fullstack Academy's web development bootcamp. Technology has always been a passion of mine and I'm hoping that FullStack Academy can provide me with the knowledge and resources to have a successful and fulfilling career.</p>
